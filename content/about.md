### Work Experience
Since May 2016, I have been working at [The Crypsis Group](https://www.crypsisgroup.com/). I started as an intern, then in March 2018 I was promoted to Junior Security Engineer, and recently I have been working as a Full Stack Developer.  
Most of my time is spent developing tools to support Incident Response cases. Occasionally I consult on them as well.

### Education
Bachelor of Science  
*Cyber Security Engineering*  
George Mason University  
May 2019  

### Cyber Competitions
I have been actively participating in cyber competitions like CTFs, CNDs, hackathons, and wargames since 2012. At GMU, I founded [Mason Competitive Cyber](https://competitivecyber.club/), which at the time I graduated was the only cyber security organization on campus with over 600 members in the club Slack.
