title: "Paul's Re-Reading List"
---

&nbsp;  
I read a lot. Instead of always reading new material, hoping that it's good, sometimes I prefer to re-read my favorite things. I will often learn something new on the second read, since I can't absorb all the information in one go.
This is a list of things that I believe are worth re-reading.  

### Nonfiction

Sapiens - Yuval Noah Harari  
Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World - Jack Weatherford  
Antifragile - Nassim Nicholas Taleb  
Fooled by Randomness - Nassim Nicholas Taleb  

### Fiction

The Lord of the Rings - J. R. R. Tolkien
